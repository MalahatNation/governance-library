## 1. Policy

It is Council's policy that all appropriate protective measures be taken to protect the lands of Malahat Nation

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that projects that require the exercise of a power or performance of a duty or function by Malahat Nation Council are considered in a careful and precautionary manner to avoid significant adverse environmental effects on Malahat lands and resources.

Until Malahat Nation enacts its own Environmental Assessment Law pursuant to the Malahat Nation Land Code, this policy must be consulted each time Council takes action or makes a decision within the scope of the Malahat Nation Land Code that may have an effect on the environment.

## 3. Scope

This Policy applies to any and all projects and designated projects that have the potential to adversely affect Malahat Nation land.

## 4. Definitions

**Applicant:** A person or entity, including Malahat Nation departments, that proposes to carry out projects on IR 11.

**Designated Projects:** Physical activities that are listed in the Impact Assessment Act Physical Activities Regulations. These are generally larger scale projects known to be likely to result in adverse environmental effects.

**Effects:** unless the context requires otherwise, changes to the environment or to health, social or economic conditions and the positive and negative consequences of these changes;

**Environment:** The components of the Earth including:

a.	land, water and air, including all layers of the atmosphere;

b.	all organic and inorganic matter and living organisms; and

c.	the interacting natural systems that include components referred to in paragraphs a and b;

**Environmental Review:** a review of a project or designated project to determine its potential environmental effects;

**Exemption List:** the list, set out in Appendix A of this Policy, of those projects that are not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects and therefore exempted from environmental screening requirements;

**Project:** A physical activity that is carried out on Malahat Nation IR 11 lands in relation to a physical work and is not a designated project.

**Qualified Environmental Professional:** an individual who carries out a part of an assessment under this policy and is:

a.	acting within the individual’s area of expertise, and in accordance with the code of ethics for the applicable regulatory body for that individual’s profession; and

b.	a member in good standing of the applicable regulatory body for any of the following professionals:
1.	an agrologist;
2.	an applied science technologist or certified technician;
3.	a registered professional biologist or registered biology technologist;
4.	a professional engineer or professional engineering licensee;
5.	a professional forester or registered forest technologist; or
6.	a professional geoscientist or professional geoscience licensee.

## 5. Regulatory Context

a.	The provisions in Annex F of Malahat Nation’s Individual Agreement with Canada set out the environmental assessment process that will apply to Malahat Nation Land until the enactment and coming into force of First Nation Laws on the subject.

b. Pursuant to the Individual Agreement, Malahat will conduct an assessment process in respect of every project on First Nation Land that is consistent with federal environmental and impact assessment legislation. This means that Malahat Nation will not carry out the project on First Nation land, or exercise any power or perform any duty or function conferred on it under the Malahat Nation Land Code or a First Nation law that would permit the project to be carried out, in whole or in part, on First nation Land, unless the Council of the First Nation determines that the carrying out of the project:
1.	is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects; or
2.	is likely to cause significant environmental effects, but those effects are justifiable in the circumstances.

c.	In this policy, environmental effects include:
1. a change to the environment that would occur on Malahat IR 11;
2. with respect to the Indigenous peoples, an effect – occurring on Malahat IR 11 and resulting from any change to the environment – on

i.	physical and cultural heritage;

ii.	the current use of lands and resources for traditional purposes; or

iii.	any structure, site or thing that is of historical, archaeological, paleontological or architectural significance; and

3. a change occurring to the health, social, or economic conditions of indigenous peoples.

## 6. Roles and Responsibilities
