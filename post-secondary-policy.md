## 6. ELIGIBILITY

Eligible students are: first nation, have maintained satisfactory academic standing, maintained good standing with the education department.  Funding applications of Malahat members will be considered before non-members.

Eligible post-secondary institutions are degree, diploma, or certificate granting institutions which are:

- Recognized by a province or territory (in Canada or abroad); or
- Educational institutions recognized to deliver post-secondary programs by arrangement within an eligible post-secondary institution.

Before applying to a post-secondary institution, the student should check with the Malahat First Nation Education Department to determine if the institution meets the eligibility requirements as required by INAC.

Eligible programs are described in section 4.3 of the National Program Guidelines. In general, to qualify for PSSSP funding, post-secondary programs must have a Grade 12 entry-level requirement (or equivalent) and must be considered to be one year in length. For UCEPP funding, the student must already be at a level that would allow for the attainment of their necessary post-secondary entry-level requirements within one year. Please review the National Program Guidelines and speak with the Education Employment and Training Department to determine if the program you are hoping to attend meets the eligibility requirements as required by INAC

### 6.1 Prioritization

[Nora to fill in]

<mark>[fluff statement about how we want as many students as possible]
Potential factors:
•	Continuing students  that completed their academic year in good standing
•	Members/non-members  (Individuals in the process of transferring to Malahat
•	Children or spouse of Malahat members and residing in the Malahat community.
•	Individuals residing in the Malahat community for a minimum period of time (ie. 6 months).)
•	Waitlisted students
•	Mature students
•	Graduate Students  (Masters, Doctorate, etc)
•	Returning students (left on good terms)
•	Returning students (did not pass last time)
•	Part time students
•	Upgrading vs. post sec
•	Students who have already started attending without Malahat support
Need to create tiers of prioritization  – e.g. Priority 1 is students who are continuing classes and who were waitlisted .

Look at westbank, nipissing, snuneymuxw

### 6.2 Educational Aid from other Agencies [do we want this?]

Students who receive scholarships or bursaries to attend post-secondary institutions BEYOND those scholarships and bursaries offered by the SFN Education Department will be eligible for funding only to the amount required to meet the cost of tuition, travel or living expenses not fully covered by the scholarship or bursary. All terms and conditions governing priorities, eligibility and funding levels must be met. Each case will be considered individually.

### 6.3 Vocational Training

See Training manual?

## 7. APPLICATION PROCESS

Students must complete and submit the Malahat First Nation Post-Secondary Education Application Form, including all supporting documentation, to the EET Coordinator by [Date   ?]

Students are responsible for ensuring that their application form is complete, signed and received by the deadline. Incomplete applications will cause delays.

Late applications will only be considered if there are sufficient funds available after processing completed applications received on time.

Any application that misrepresents the student’s circumstances, or a spouse’s circumstances (where the student is claiming living allowance in relation to a spouse), will result in denial of funding or cancellation of funding.

Required Documentation:
- Copy of status card (both sides);
- Copy of acceptance letter from an eligible post-secondary program that will be delivered by an eligible post-secondary institution;
- Statement of Grades or an email from the Registrar's office with the applicant's grades.
- Official Transcripts from all institutions attended (official transcripts are signed and sealed by the institution and have not been opened.  Photocopies, scanned and emailed copies and faxes of official transcripts do not meet the reporting requirements for PSE funding)

## 8. LEVELS OF ASSISTANCE/STUDENT STATUS

Assistance can be provided at four different levels or stages of post-secondary education. The duration of assistance must align with the official length of a program as defined by the post-secondary institution; assistance for up to one additional academic year can be provided if an extension is needed and the necessity of a student to do that must be provided in writing by the post-secondary institution’s dean or program department head.

Level 1 Diploma or Certificate Programs

Level 2 Undergraduate University Programs

Level 3 Advanced or Professional Degree Programs/Masters Programs

Level 4 Doctoral Programs

PSE funding may be available only once at each Level unless a student has already achieved completion at that level, even if they did not receive assistance during that time. In addition, assistance can only be provided for a student to achieve a higher level of post-secondary education than they already have. For example, a student who has achieved a Master’s Degree cannot be funded again at that same level (Level 3) and cannot be funded at a lower level, even if they had never received PSE funding at one of those levels before.

The only exception is at Level 2 (university degree programs); PSE funding may be available for an additional degree in a bachelor program which requires an undergraduate degree as a prerequisite.

### 8.1 Part time/Full time

Part-time students may receive assistance for tuition and compulsory fees, the actual cost of required books and supplies, and a proportional living allowance.

### 8.2 UCEPP

Students applying for assistance through UCEPP must obtain a statement from the relevant institution (i.e. college or university), which attests that:

- The UCEPP program will provide the student with the necessary courses to attain the academic level for university or college entrance; and
- The student will be eligible for admittance as a student of a regular university or college credit program upon successful completion of the UCEPP course of studies  .

For UCEPP, the maximum length of time supports can be provided is for one (1) academic year. At the end of the first semester ongoing financial support will be subject to confirmation from the institution that the student is in good academic standing.

## 9. FUNDING

<mark>do we want a section regarding overpayments?

Malahat First Nation receives limited PSE funding from INAC for the delivery of PSSSP and UCEPP. This funding may be below the level required to support all eligible students, and is not sufficient to cover 100% of approved students’ costs to attend PSE programs. In the event that there are more applications for funding than that which is available, selection of applicants will be based on the order of priority set out in section three.

The National Program Guidelines refer to maximum amounts of funding that can be provided to students and describe how no students are entitled to these amounts. The actual amount of funding available to eligible students will depend on the overall amount of funding available to Malahat First Nation during a given fiscal year (April to March). Funding must be expended according to eligibility guidelines as shown in the National Program guidelines and cannot be backdated to cover a period of time before a student has been approved for support.

Generally, the following types of expenses may be eligible:

- Tuition and mandatory student fees;
- Books and supplies;
- Living allowance and, in some cases, travel;
- Costs for guidance and counseling may be considered eligible and may or may not be considered, based on available PSE funding, need and access to services.

Required to opt out of Health and dental plan offered by Uni?

### 9.1 Tuition

Malahat First Nation will pay approved tuition amounts directly to the post-secondary institution upon receiving an invoice. In the case that a post-secondary institution    does not bill Malahat First Nation directly, students are responsible to forward invoices directly from the institution to the [ ] First Nation along with any necessary supporting documentation, information and deadlines.

Limits to and approval of expenses are subject to available funding and to the limits of assistance set out in the National Program Guidelines. Students are responsible for making sure they pursue other sources of funding if the PSE funding is not going to be enough to meet their financial needs.

### 9.2 Books and Supplies

Full-time and part-time students may receive assistance for books and supplies that are required for their program of study. Students must submit a copy of the course calendar and book list.

An allowance of $______ for books and supplies will be issued at the beginning of the school year after the course calendar and book list have been received.

No books or supply expenses will be reimbursed without the original paid receipts. Arrangements may be made for payments to be made directly to the bookstore.

### 9.3 Living Allowance

All students will receive a living allowance of [  ] amount, based on the following rubric:

[Nora to include]

<mark>From nanaimo:
Living allowance is provided only to Full-Time Students in College Prep, Level I and Level
II Programs. For greater certainty, living allowance is not provided to Part-Time
Students or Students in advanced or professional degree programs (i.e. Level III).
11.2 Living allowance is intended to cover the costs of necessaries: food, shelter (rent and
damage deposit), utilities and clothing.
11.3 In order to ensure a fair allocation of financial resources to all eligible students, living
allowances will be adjusted for those students whose financial circumstances change
during the course of the studies. Students are required to notify the SFN Education
Department immediately if there is a change to their financial circumstance, such as
when there is a change to the number of dependents, if their previously unemployed
spouse gains employment or a Family Maintenance Order is granted. All documentation
must be submitted to the Education Department within 2 weeks of becoming available.
11.4 Students are eligible to receive financial assistance to a maximum of $80/per month for
public transportation. These funds are expected to cover the expense of the BC U-Pass
for those students that require it.
11.5 Currently the SFN Education Department is not in a position to financially assist students
with child care costs. However, low income students who are residents of BC may be
eligible for assistance from BC's Ministry of Children and Family Development. For
eligibility criteria go to the following link:
http://www.mcf.gov.bc.ca/childcare/subsidy_promo.htm. Students studying outside of
BC are encouraged to inquire with the local provincial government for possible child
care subsidies.

### 9.4 Shelter Allowance

<mark>This should probably be included in living allowance?

### 9.5 High Rent Allowance

<mark>Covered in living allowance section from nanaimo

### 9.6 Travel Allowance

Full-time funded students who must travel [more than ______ km] from their place of ordinary residence to attend their Post-Secondary Institution may be eligible to receive financial support for the cost of [one][two] return trip(s), up to a maximum of $______ per academic year. The student may be eligible to receive travel allowance for his/her dependents as well.

In applying for travel assistance, students are expected to use the most economical means of travel possible. Students wishing to apply for travel assistance must complete a Travel Assistance Request Form [at least 4 weeks] prior to the expected date of travel.

Students taking classes through distance education or e-learning who are required to travel to another location to complete their required exams can be eligible for travel support. Where possible, students should request accommodation (such as taking the exam in the local school under the supervision of a teacher or school principal) to minimize need for travel  .

### 9.8 Deferred Studies

If a student changes programs within one of the Levels or temporarily pauses their studies, the number of academic years or semesters used at that Level are still counted for reporting purposes and must be considered when calculating the amount of time that may be available for assistance. Therefore, students must be aware that such changes may affect the overall funding available and how this may affect their ability to complete their program.

Before making any changes, students must discuss this with the Education Department to ensure they will still be eligible for PSE funding or not.

Students who become eligible for assistance and have already completed a portion of their post-secondary studies without assistance may receive assistance for the balance of their program of studies, but cannot be reimbursed for previous expenses as according to the National Program Guidelines.

### 9.9 Deferred Students

Deferred students are students who met all eligibility requirements for PSE support with Malahat Nation, but were unable to be funded due to financial constraints. Deferred students will be placed on a waitlist in the order in which their application was received. As additional funding becomes available, waitlisted students will be funded in the sequence in which they were waitlisted.

### 9.10 Personal Challenges[Nora?]

### 9.11 Wait List

A wait list will be established each year beginning in September.  Students whose names are on the wait list will be notified of their position.  This list will be affected by various factors, including returning students, number of graduating students, students' success, and the amount of funds available to MN for Post-Secondary Education wach year.

### 9.12 Tutoring Expenses

Students must apply to the MN Education office prior to engaging the services of a tutor.  Limited funds are available for tutoring services and will be available on an individual basis after other avenues are exhausted.  Many institutions provide tutors for First Nation students as part of their services.  The students must access these tutors first.  If the available tutor is not able to provide tutoring in the required area of need then services of another tutor may be enlisted after consultation with the Malahat Nation Education Office.

### 9.13 Counseling Services

Funding may be available for guidance and counseling services for students enrolled in eligible programs and for individuals intending to apply to a Post-Secondary Institution.

### 9.14 Supplementary Funding for Special Events [Nora]

Supplementary requests for Special Events could include such activities as conferences/workshops, graduation and/or cultural events that are specifically related to the student's course of study.

Requests for special events travel should include:

- Letter from student outlining the particulars of the trip, workshop, etc. to the Education Department.

- A completed submission that includes the budget (including own funds contributed), a description of the special event and a letter from the instructor supporting the student's participation as it relates to course of study.

All requests should be received by the Education Office at least one month prior to the actual event.  Approval is based on the availability of funds.  Late submissions will not be considered for funding.

### 9.15 High Cost Programs

Programs that differ a great deal in terms of cost or delivery in comparison with programs that are available locally can only be approved if all supporting documentation is in place, as described by the National Program Guidelines. Approving high cost programs or those that are offered at an accelerated pace can significantly reduce the number of applicants who can be sponsored through PSE Funding in a fiscal year.

The National Program Guidelines describe the maximum payable per full time student under PSSSP or UCEPP as $35,000 per year. All costs over $35,000 must be preapproved by INAC, BC Region before approval can be granted

## 10. Funding Limitations

<mark>Covered within funding section?

## 11. Student Incentives and Scholarships

<mark>Bursaries, graduation rewards, scholarships.

## 12. Termination/Suspension of Funding

Options: False statements, change from full time to part time, withdrawal, failing, absences, breach of student contract.

Where a student has his or her funding suspended in accordance with these Guidelines, the student must work with the Education Department and take all necessary steps to rectify the breach that caused the suspension of funding. Once steps have been taken to the satisfaction of the Education Department, the student’s funding may be reinstated.

Where a student has had his or her funding terminated in accordance with these Guidelines, he or she will not be eligible for further financial assistance unless and until the student repays the full amount of the funding provided to the student to the First Nation. Where a student repays the full amount , he or she will be considered to be in good standing with the First Nation PSE Financial Assistance Program and may apply for funding in accordance with these Guidelines.

### 12.1 Academic Probation

a. Students are required to maintain a C+ average. Any student who falls below a C+ average will be given the opportunity to bring up their marks with the assistance of a tutor.

b. Students are responsible for informing the Education Department when they’re experiencing difficulty in maintaining a C+ average within 8 weeks of commencing their studies. Students failing to maintain a C+ average will be placed on academic probation by the MN Education Department.

d. Cheques for the following month will not be released unless the monthly report has been received. If the reports provided do not meet the C+ criteria for 2 consecutive months sponsorship will be discontinued.

e. Students who drop below a C+ average and fail an academic semester as determined by the Post-secondary Institution will be required to repay the MN Education Department for the tuition and living allowance provided in that semester at the discretion of the Education Department.

f. Students who wish to continue their studies the following semester and receive financial sponsorship from Malahat Nation will be required to pay for one Academic Year of studies at their own expense.

## 13. Appeals

16.1 There can be no appeal against failure to fund because of insufficiency of funds or
where funds have been fully committed or where a student’s errors, omissions or failure
