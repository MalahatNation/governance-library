### 3.2 Application Requirements

The following requirements must be met by Applicants who wish to be considered for allocation of a Rental Unit. If any of these requirements are not met, the Housing Department: shall not accept the Housing Application and shall advise the applicant that the application requirements were not met.

#### Housing Application Form

In order to be considered for allocation of a Rental Unit, the Applicant must submit a completed Housing Application to the Housing Department that includes:

- Written consent from the Applicant to speak to the references and verify employment and/or financial information submitted in support of the Housing Application.

Housing Applications on file with the Housing Department must be updated by the Applicant on an annual basis and whenever there is a change to the information contained in the Housing Application in order to remain on the Waiting List.

Applicants receiving Shelter Allowance must provide proof of income or some other form of income/social assistance &amp; must maintain an up-to-date file with the Band Social Development Worker in the Community Programs Department.

In shared parenting time arrangements, written proof must be provided to the Housing Department demonstrating said arrangements. This can be provided by either the guardians or parents but is necessary before evaluating the housing application.

#### Membership and Age Requirement

To submit a Housing Application for the allocation of a Rental Unit, the Applicant must be: a Member or a Non-member with primary care of a minor Member child and provide their status number; and eighteen (18) years of age or older, unless there are extenuating circumstances. Some of the extenuating circumstances that may be taken into account when deciding whether to accept a Housing Application from an Applicant who is under the age of eighteen (18) are:

- health or safety issues affecting the Applicant and/or any dependents;
- overcrowding in the Applicant&#39;s current residence;
- accessibility;
- family violence;
- child welfare;
- the fact the Applicant has withdrawn from parental control;
- marital breakdown and/or changes in the Applicant&#39;s marital status;
- the fact the Applicant&#39;s current residence was destroyed or rendered uninhabitable by fire or as another consequence of circumstances of Force Majeure

#### Arrears and Rental History

Applicants must be in good standing with Malahat Nation to be eligible for a rental unit. Good standing means that any Arrears are paid in full or an Arrears Agreement has been created between the Tenant and the Housing Department.

If the Applicant was previously Evicted from a Nation-Owned Home, Malahat Nation and the Housing Department reserve the right to reject the Applicant&#39;s Housing Application for this reason. The Housing Department shall act in the best interest of the Nation when considering this circumstance.

If the Applicant previously caused damage to a Nation-Owned home, Malahat Nation and the Housing Department reserves the right to require a damage deposit exceeding one month&#39;s rent to protect the Nation&#39;s housing stock.

Safety, Overcrowding, and Medical Issue Considerations

Due to capacity issues, the Scoring Application Guide will be used to ensure that Applicants who do not already have access to safe housing will be given priority in housing allocations.

Changes to Household Composition

Rental Unit allocations are decided based on the information in Housing Applications, including information on Household Composition. If there are changes to Household Composition after an allocation is made, the Housing Department may reassess the allocation. If it is determined that the allocation is no longer appropriate because of changes to the Household Composition, the Rental Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and if the Tenant submits a new Housing Application it will be placed on the Waiting List.

If the Housing Department determines that a Tenant intentionally provided untrue or inaccurate information about Household Composition on the Housing Application, and the allocation has already been made, the Tenant may be Evicted.

Incomplete Applications

If applications are found to be incomplete, the housing department will do as follows:

1. Contact the applicant at least 3 (three) times to give them a chance to complete the application and;
2. Send a letter to their listed address notifying including contact information and in-person office hours.

### 3.3 Criteria for Deciding Rental Unit Allocations

Providing safe, affordable and energy efficient housing for all Members is a priority for Malahat Nation. Unfortunately, the need for Rental Units often exceeds capacity and available funding.

A completed Housing Application will include the information needed to score the Housing Application in accordance with the Application Scoring Guide. The Application Scoring Guide provides an unbiased assessment of the Applicant&#39;s current living conditions, affordability analysis (ability to pay utilities and rent) and confirmation of Household Composition.

The size of unit considered for each application will be based upon the number of bedrooms required stated on the housing application by the applicant. It is the applicant&#39;s responsibility to request the number of bedrooms in accordance with the National Occupancy Standard.

If the number of bedrooms requested are not in accordance with the National Occupancy Standard applicants must provide the housing department with information explaining the extenuating circumstances that support their request. It is the responsibility of the applicant to update the housing department if the number of occupants that they wish to reside in their unit changes from what they have stated on their application.

Deviations from the National Occupancy Standard will only be made when the Housing Department has determined that the occupants will remain in a safe living situation. Any deviations from the National Occupancy Standards are required to be approved in writing by the CAO.

To provide a fair and transparent method for allocating Rental Units and to ensure that Rental Units are allocated to Applicants on the basis of relative merit and in accordance with the community&#39;s housing goals and this Housing Policy, the following procedure will be followed:

- Completed Housing Applications must be submitted to the Housing Department by the Applicant and must be updated by the Applicant on an annual basis to remain on the Waiting List;
- The Housing Department will score each completed Housing Application it receives using the Application Scoring Guide; and
- When a Rental Unit becomes available, the Housing Manager will allocate Rental Units on the verified scores of Active Housing Applications and, if necessary, the Household Composition of eligible Applicants.

When reviewing scores and making recommendations for allocations, The Housing Manager must follow the conflict of interest guidelines.

If two Housing Applications receive the same score and the Household Compositions of each Applicant are equally suited to the available Rental Unit, the tie maybe broken by who applied first according to the dates recorded on the Housing Applications.

Once the housing department has evaluated all relevant applications, The Allocation Review form will be filled out summarizing the process and recommending to the CAO a specific allocation. Upon review that the process was properly followed, the CAO may then affirm the designation by signing the Allocation Review. At this point the home will be allocated to the appropriate applicant and the Housing Manager may sign the lease.

### 3.4 Emergency Shelter

From time to time, the CAO may authorize emergency shelter on a temporary basis with a periodic tenancy, which will typically be month-to-month. Emergency shelter may not offer all of the equipment, services, and occupancy latitude standard in permanent housing. Specifically, neither guests nor subleases will typically be permitted in emergency shelter.

Members who wish to be considered for emergency shelter should contact the Housing Department and explain their need. The Housing Department will gather information to provide to the CAO, but will not require a full Rental Application and customary application evaluation. The requirement that rental vacancies be advertised for a standard amount of time shall not apply to emergency shelter.

When emergency shelter is provided, a Rental Agreement will be signed and rent will be paid in accordance with this policy. All tenant responsibilities in this Housing Policy shall apply.

If a member resides in emergency shelter and wishes to apply for a permanent rental unit, he or she shall submit a Housing Application to be scored in accordance with this Policy. The applicant shall be presumed to reside in temporary housing, and need not submit additional proof of this to the Housing Department.

### 3.5 Rental Agreement

The Rental Agreement has been developed to protect the Rental Unit, the Tenant and Malahat Nation. The Rental Agreement sets out the rights and obligations of the Tenant and of Malahat Nation.

For the duration of the Rental Agreement, the Rental Unit is the Tenant&#39;s home and the Tenant is entitled to quiet enjoyment and exclusive use of the Rental Unit, reasonable privacy, and freedom from unreasonable disturbance.

Rental Agreements are prepared to be generally consistent with provincial residential tenancy legislation as well as the goals and rules set out by the Malahat Nation in this Housing Policy or otherwise.

Prior to entering into a Rental Agreement, the Housing Department will complete an in-person meeting with the Tenant to explain all aspects of the Rental Program the Rental Agreement and this Housing Policy, including all rights and obligations of Tenants, charges payable by Tenants and consequences of breaching the Rental Agreement and/or this Policy.

Subject to Malahat Nation policies, each Rental Agreement shall describe the Tenant&#39;s responsibility for Rent payments, regular Rental Unit maintenance, utility payments, and any services provided to the Rental Unit by Malahat Nation, including without limitation, garbage pickup and snow removal.

Rental Agreements shall be signed by the Chief Administrative Officer, or the Housing Manager if authority has been specifically delegated, and the Tenant prior to the Tenant occupying the Rental Unit. All Tenants must sign a Rental Agreement. The Housing Department shall keep the original Rental Agreements and provide copies to Tenants.

If the Tenant is receiving income/social assistance, the Rental Agreement must be provided to the Band Social Development Worker (BSDW) in the Community Programs Department by the Tenant to ensure eligibility for Shelter Allowance payments; If approved by the BSDW, this must be communicated with the Housing Department.

Rental Agreements shall be reviewed and renewed by the Tenant annually.

Tenants and/or the Housing Department shall also update Rental Agreements when needed to reflect any policy updates, or changes to the list of occupants, Tenant contact information or Rent rates. For greater clarity, **a**** ll** Rental Agreements shall be renewed by April 1st of every year unless the rental agreement has been signed within 90 days of April 1st. If a Rental Agreement is not renewed, the Rental Agreement shall remain in effect as a month to month tenancy on the same terms. A month to month tenancy may be terminated by Landlord or Tenant at any time by providing 30-day written notice. In the case of a Tenant terminating the agreement, the Tenant shall be responsible for payment of any rent coming due within the 30-day period.

### 3.15 Death of a Tenant

In the event of a Tenant&#39;s death and there are still Tenants listed on the lease, the lease is considered valid unless the remaining Tenant(s) wishes to terminate the lease.

In the event of a Tenant&#39;s death, the CAO or, if explicitly delegated, the Housing Manager, may reassign the deceased Tenant&#39;s Rental Agreement. Members already living in the Rental Unit will be given priority in the following order:

- Spouse of the deceased Tenant;

The Housing Department will then re-allocate the Rental Unit in accordance with this policy and the waiting list.

### 3.16 Marital Breakdown


In the case of marital breakdown where there are no children of the relationship, both parties are Members and the Rental Agreement is in both names, Malahat Nation will ask the Tenants to work out an arrangement where one of the Tenants retains the right to possession of the Rental Unit. If the Tenants are unable to work out an arrangement within thirty (30) days, both parties will submit a Housing Application to the Housing Department and the Housing Department will score the applications using the Application Scoring Guide. The highest score will retain possession of the Rental Unit and the right to occupy it. Upon the Housing Manager or the designated Housing Department employee(s) allocating the Rental Unit, the new Tenant must enter into and sign a Rental Agreement with the Housing Department.

In the case of marital breakdown where there are no children of the relationship, both parties are Members but the Rental Agreement is in only one Member&#39;s name, the Rental Agreement will remain in that Member&#39;s name and he/she will retain possession of the Rental Unit and the right to occupy it.

In the case of marital breakdown where there are no children of the relationship and one of the parties is a Non-member, the Rental Agreement will remain in the name of the Member.

In the case of marital breakdown where there are children of the relationship, the following rules will apply:

- If both parents are Members, the parent who has primary care of the child (or children) will retain possession of the Rental Unit and will have the right to occupy it. If the parent with primary care of the child (or children) is not named as a Tenant on the original Rental Agreement, then he/she will be required to enter into a new Rental Agreement.

- If the parent with primary care of the child (or children) and the child (or children) are all Non-members, the parent will be offered a new tenancy agreement allowing them to reside in the rental unit for up to six (6) months. At the conclusion of six (6) months the parent will have the option to sign a new lease if they are eligible under this housing policy. If they are not eligible tenants, they will have to vacate the unit at the conclusion of the 6 month lease.

- If the child (or children) is a Member and the parent with primary care of the child (or children) is a Non-member, the Non-member parent with primary care of the child (or children) will retain possession of the Rental Unit and will have the right to occupy the Rental Unit so long as the Member child (or children) lives there and the Non-member parent retains primary care of the child (or children). The Non-member parent will be required to enter into a Rental Agreement. Once the Member child has reached the age of majority (eighteen (18) years of age), the Member child may enter into a Rental Agreement and the Non-member Spouse/parent/guardian may continue to occupy the home as an authorized occupant in accordance with this Policy.

### 3.17 Subleases of Rental Units

#### Prohibited Transfers

Rental Agreements and the right to occupy a Rental Unit may not be transferred or assigned without the prior written approval of the Housing Department.

A Tenant **cannot** transfer a Rental Agreement nor the right to occupy a Rental Unit because the Tenant no longer requires the Rental Unit. In such cases, the Tenant may move out of the Rental Unit after providing the Housing Department with thirty (30) days&#39; notice. The Rental Unit will then be re-allocated in accordance with this Policy and the Waiting List. However, the Housing Department reserves the right to review such situations on a case by case basis.

#### Application Procedure

Under certain circumstances, a Tenant may apply to the Housing Department for permission to sublet his/her Rental Unit to another Member.

Tenants may apply to sublet a Rental Unit for any of the following reasons:

- health reasons (e.g. the Tenant requires long-term hospitalization);
- changes to social assistance eligibility;
- educational reasons (e.g. the Tenant is going away to attend school)
- employment reasons; or
- for other reasons the Housing Department deems appropriate.

Tenants applying for a Sublease must submit the following to the Housing Department:

- a completed Sublease Application Form (Available upon request from Housing Department); and

- a letter of explanation outlining the situation.

Sublease Applications must be accompanied by supporting documentation as follows:

- for health-related Subleases, the Tenant must provide a letter from his/her physician stating the need for extended hospitalization or out of town treatment and an estimate of how long the hospitalization or out of town treatment will be required; or

- for education-related Subleases, the Tenant must provide a copy of his/her letter of acceptance or other proof of enrolment from the educational institution the Tenant will be attending.

The Housing Department will review Sublease Applications and the CAO approve Subleases where a Sublease is appropriate in all the circumstances on a case by case basis.

Sublease Agreement

Once the Housing Department has approved a Sublease, the Subtenant taking over the Rental Unit will enter into a Sublease Agreement with Malahat Nation.

The Sublease Agreement must state:

- the terms and conditions of the Sublease, including that the Subtenant will be responsible for paying Rent and maintaining the Rental Unit in good condition;

- that the Subtenant will have all the responsibilities of a Tenant for the life of the Sublease Agreement;

- that Malahat Nation may enforce the terms of the Sublease Agreement against the Subtenant as though the Subtenant were the primary Tenant;

- that the Subtenant accepts the Rental Unit on an "as is" basis;

- that by signing the Sublease Agreement the Subtenant acknowledges he/she is aware of his/her responsibility for securing his/her own accommodations after the Sublease Agreement expires; and

- when the Sublease Agreement expires and terminates and/or if the Sublease Agreement may be renewed with proof of enrolment in an educational institution.

The maximum term for a Sublease Agreement will typically be two (2) years. However, if the Tenant is applying for a Sublease to attend school, the length of the sublease may be for the duration of the program he/she is enrolled in. The Tenant must provide the Housing Department with proof of enrolment every year or the Sublease and the Sublease Agreement will be terminated. For greater certainty, the Sublease Agreement must state when it and the Sublease expires and/or if it may be renewed with proof of enrolment in an educational institution.

A Sublease may be cancelled at any time upon the mutual agreement of the primary Tenant and the Subtenant. The Tenant and Subtenant must provide the Housing Department with thirty (30) days&#39; notice of their desire to cancel a Sublease, if they fail to do so the Housing Department may refuse to terminate the Sublease Agreement for a period of up to thirty (30) days.

### Survival of the Rental Agreement

The Rental Agreement between Malahat Nation and the original Tenant remains in force for the duration of the Sublease and survives the expiration and/or termination of the Sublease Agreement. The original Tenant is ultimately responsible to ensure that all the obligations of the Rental Agreement, including paying Rent and utilities, are met. This means that if the Subtenant breaches the terms of the Sublease Agreement and Malahat Nation is unable to recover Arrears, costs, damages or other expenses from the Subtenant, the original Tenant will be responsible.

If the Subtenant is Evicted by Malahat Nation or abandons the Rental Unit, the original Tenant will be considered to have been evicted as well.

If a Tenant allows another Member or person to reside in a Rental Unit without the approval of the Housing Department, the Tenant will be responsible for any damage to the Rental Unit and may be subject to Eviction.

### 3.18 Eviction &amp; Termination of a Rental Agreement


Malahat Nation may Evict a Tenant where a Rental Agreement is terminated due to breach of this Housing Policy and/or the Rental Agreement. Malahat Nation considers Eviction to be a last resort to be taken when all attempts to resolve the issues have failed. Prior to taking Eviction action, the Housing Department will make every effort to provide reasonable warning(s) and may attempt to meet with the Tenant to reinforce the consequences of failing to resolve the breach of the Rental Agreement and/or this Policy

Any person occupying a Rental Unit without the permission of the Housing Department will be Evicted immediately and without notice.

Tenants or persons within a Rental Unit may be Evicted by the CAO for any of the following reasons. This list is non-exhaustive and is intended solely to provide examples of possible bases for eviction.

1. making false declarations on a Housing Application that results in a housing allocation;
2. being convicted of engaging in illegal activities in a Nation-Owned House
3. causing willful damage to a Rental Unit and/or property within or on a Rental Unit that belongs to Malahat Nation
4. the Tenant, an Authorized Occupant and/or guest has caused a nuisance or an on-going disturbance to the community or has adversely affected or is likely to adversely affect the health, safety or well-being of the community;
5. the Tenant ceases to be a member of Malahat Nation or there are no Authorized Occupants who are members of Malahat Nation;
6. the Tenant does not repair, clean and/or maintain the Rental Unit as required under this Agreement;
7. the Tenant fails to fulfill the terms of their Arrears Agreement; or
8. breaching a term of this Policy and/or a Rental Agreement or Sublease Agreement.

For clarity, the Housing Department recommends evictions to the CAO, who makes the final decision whether to Evict a Tenant. If a Housing Committee has been established, the CAO may delegate authority over this section to the Housing Committee.

#### Disturbances &amp; Complaints

Complaints regarding a Tenant must be provided in writing and submitted to the Housing Department. Complaints will only be discussed with complainants and the Tenant who is the subject of the complaint and the identity of complainants will be kept confidential. If, in the opinion of the Housing Department, a Tenant is causing a nuisance or an on-going disturbance, a warning may be issued.

Warnings

If it has been determined a breach of the Rental Agreement has occurred, the Housing Department will undertake the following steps:

1. First Written warning;
2. Second Written warning(s); and
3. Eviction.

Tenants who have received one (1) or more warnings but have not been Evicted will return to good standing with the Housing Department provided they do not receive any additional warnings for at least one (1) year.

Eviction

When an eviction notice has been issued, the housing department will declare the tenancy ended for the tenant or occupant to whom the notice has been issued. If any or all others occupants are residing in the home they will need to come forward and sign a tenancy agreement with the Housing Department if they qualify for housing. They will be given first refusal of the occupying home. Upon receiving an eviction notice, the Tenant will have 10 days to vacate the Rental Unit and shall leave the Rental Unit in the condition required under § 3.17. At the conclusion of that 10 days the tenancy and the Tenant&#39;s rights under this agreement shall cease absolutely, without right of re-entry, and the Landlord or it&#39;s agent may re-enter the Rental Unit or any part of it, and thereafter have, possess, and enjoy it as if no Rental Agreement had been made.

Exigent circumstances

While every effort will be made to follow the aforementioned notice period, if exigent circumstances are present, the Housing Department may eliminate the notice requirement and reduce the time to vacate to as short as 24 hours. Exigent circumstances could include, but are not limited to: removing a Tenant who is a danger to other residents acting for the safety of the children, or removing a violent tenant.

If a Tenant is Evicted from a Rental Unit, the Housing Department may reject any subsequent Housing Application submitted by the former Tenant if it is in the best interest of the Nation.

Where the reason for Eviction is Arrears, the Tenant will not qualify for future housing until the Arrears are paid in full.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Malahat Nation may consider Housing Applications of former Tenants who were Evicted at any time on a case by case basis.

### 3.19 Vacating a Rental Unit

All Tenants shall notify the Housing Department, in writing, thirty (30) days prior to vacating a Rental Unit. A notice to end this Agreement given by the Tenant the day before the rent is due in a given month ends the tenancy at the end of the following month. _[For example, if the Tenant wants to move at the end of May, the Tenant must make sure the Landlord receives written notice on or before April 30th.]_

In the event a Tenant vacates the home and there are still Tenants listed on the lease, the lease is considered valid unless the remaining Tenant(s) wishes to terminate the lease.

In the event a Tenant vacates the home and there is no other Tenant listed on the agreement, the CAO or, if explicitly delegated, the Housing Manager, may reassign the deceased Tenant&#39;s Rental Agreement. Members already living in the Rental Unit will be given priority in the following order:

- Spouse of the deceased Tenant;
- adult children of the deceased Tenant that are eighteen (18) years of age or older;
- legal guardian(s) of any minor children of the deceased Tenant; and
- a Member who lives in the Rental Unit who is willing to assume all Tenant responsibilities for the Rental Unit, including the responsibility of paying Rent.

In order for a person listed above to begin to occupy or to continue to occupy the Rental Unit, a new Rental Agreement must be entered into and signed by the new Tenant and the Housing Department. If none of the above listed persons requires the Rental Unit, the Rental Unit will be re-allocated in accordance with this Policy and the Waiting List.

The notice required under this section must be in writing and must:

1. include the address of the Rental Unit;
2. include the date the tenancy and this Agreement is to end; and
3. be signed and dated by the Tenant.

The Tenant shall vacate the Rental Unit by 1 p.m. on the day the tenancy and this Agreement is deemed to end and leave the unit in a re-rentable condition.

Re-rentable condition means that:

1. floors are cleaned and washed;
2. walls are cleaned and washed;
3. carpets are vacuumed and cleaned and any stains are shampooed out;
4. all electric light bulbs are functioning and in place;
5. the refrigerator and/or freezer is cleaned of all food and stains and defrosted and there are no debris under or behind the refrigerator and/or freezer;

9. all garbage has been removed from the Rental Unit; and
10. the washer and dryer are cleaned inside and out and there is no debris under or behind the washer or dryer.

If a Tenant vacates a Rental Unit without informing the Housing Department, the Rental Unit may be deemed abandoned, the Tenant may be deemed to have been evicted and the Rental Unit may be re-allocated in accordance with this Policy and the Waiting List.

If the Tenant does not vacate the Rental Unit at the required date defined in the termination of rental notice, the Housing Department may obtain the services of law enforcement to assist with removing the Tenant.

A Tenant who leaves personal property in the Rental Unit after vacating the Rental Unit and is, therefore, no longer authorized to have access to the Rental Unit, must contact the Housing Department in order to enter the Rental Unit and remove the personal property within thirty (30) days of vacating the Rental Unit. After that time, the Housing Department may dispose of the personal property at its discretion. The Tenant will be responsible for any costs incurred by the Housing Department in disposing of the personal property, and these costs will be a debt owed to and recoverable by Malahat Nation.

### 4.2 Rental of Privately-Owned Homes

A Homeowner of a Privately-Owned Home may rent out a portion of or all of the Privately-Owned Home to a Private Tenant through a private landlord / tenant arrangement. The Homeowner may set the rent and make conditions of occupancy without any prior approval of Council or the Housing Department as long as the arrangement is in compliance with all Malahat Nation bylaws.

Federal Law and policy provides the guidelines of eligibility that must be met in order for a person receiving income/social assistance to qualify for Shelter Allowance within a prescribed test. Members on income/social assistance wishing to rent a Privately-Owned Home must have a written and signed lease (rental) agreement with the landlord Homeowner in place before any rent can be paid with Shelter Allowance. The lease agreement must be pre-approved by the Band Social Development Worker (BSDW) in the Community Programs Department and Housing Department in order for the Private Tenant to be eligible for Shelter Allowance. A copy of the signed lease agreement must be provided to the BSDW and Housing Department.

In order to assist landlord Homeowners, a Sample Private Rental Agreement has been developed to protect the Privately-Owned Home, the Private Tenant and the Homeowner. The Sample Private Rental Agreement sets out the Private Tenant&#39;s obligations and the obligations of the landlord Homeowner. The Sample Private Rental Agreement was developed in order to meet AANDC requirements for shelter allowance.

It is the responsibility of the Homeowner to seek independent legal advice over the use of this Sample Private Rental Agreement. Malahat Nation is not liable for any actions/ liabilities as a result of implementing this Sample Private Rental Agreement. Malahat Nation is not responsible for upkeep, repairs, maintenance, and services to the Privately-Owned Home, except in the ordinary course or as otherwise provide in this Policy. All insurance is the sole responsibility of the landlord Homeowner and the Private Tenant.

## Section 5.0 – Renovation Program

### 5.1 Renovation Program

**Housing would like to provide a renovation program that is fair to all community members.**

**Currently, the bulk of housing renovation income is derived from external agencies. As housing relies heavily on outside resources for renovation funding, we must abide by certain rules (CMHC/AANDC rules).**

**Housing would like to make sure that every eligible home will be considered for current and/or future renovations. We will also make sure that renovations are completed to B.C. building code standards.**

Renovation differ from general maintenance of the home. While renovations consist of generally larger projects that change the structure of a unit with emphasis on changing or upgrading it,

While maintenance means care and or upkeep of a unit that is planned routine or urgent that keeps the structure in proper condition or in working order.

## Section 6.0 – Appeal Process
